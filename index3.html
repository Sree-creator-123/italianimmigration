    <h1>Italian immigration to America</h1>
    <h4>By: Sreecharan Chakka</h4>
    <h2>Why did Italians move to the United States?</h2>
    <p>Italians wanted to move to the United States because of the wars and natural disasters like the Renaissance war and the 1906 Mount Vesuvius eruption. The wars and natural disasters caused people to get  diseases and most of them got <strong>unemployed</strong>.</p>
    <h2>How did Italians come to the United States?</h2>
    <p>First, they had to go on a 3,000-mile journey from Italy to America on a sailboat. It took about 3 months to just go from Italy to America. After a few years, the steamboat was introduced to the world. It cut the trip from 3 months to 10 days. People mostly booked Steerage or Third class because they were the cheapest. They had to sail in dirty clothes and had to eat unsanitary food. Each ticket cost $30 and that was a lot of money back in the 1800s. So, $30 back then is equal to about $875.40 now.</p>
    <h2>What were the US immigration laws?</h2>
    <p>The US Immigration law was that every immigrant who had landed at the US port had to pay a “head tax” of 50 cents before they go to Ellis Island. Back in the time, 50 cents was a lot of money. People were mad at the law because they didn’t have enough money to at least buy a ticket and now they had to pay an extra tax.</p>
    <h2>What was Ellis Island and how did it work?</h2>
    <p>Ellis Island is located at the upper New York bay. It served as an inspection station for all immigrants who wanted to reside in America. Before they arrived at Ellis Island, they were first greeted by the Statue of Liberty. Next, they were taken into Ellis Island for legal and medical inspections. First, they started with the medical inspections. Doctors would take a buttonhook and turn the eyelids inside-out. If there is a medical condition, then the doctor would take a piece of chalk and write letters on the immigrant's coat like “X” for mental disability. Sometimes they would be sent to the Ellis Island hospital or they would be sent back to their country. Next, the immigrants had to answer 32 questions in order to determine that they should be admitted to America.</p>
    <h2>Where did Italians move in the United States?</h2>
    <p>About 20% emigrated from wine growing areas in Northern Italy and set up a home in California and other states in the west. The Italians from the south tended to move to the big cities in North East America. Almost ⅓ of the immigrants who came to America lived in New York City. By 1890, the population of New York City approached 2 million and 42% of the population was foreign-born. In the 1800s, the population of Italians in the United States was around 600,000. By the mid-1920s, more than 4 million Italians <strong>emigrated</strong> to America and they represented more than 10% on the nation’s foreign-born population.</p>
